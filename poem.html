<h2>Does is mess you up?</h2>
&nbsp;
Got my career on my mind, money drop in New York City
Look in the mirror, and I'm like, so hot, so smart, so witty
Mentally in a gun fight, thank God I keep so busy
Some things you know I'll never show, oh
I am <a>href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00PwBHUo1NYnobody's" target=>Nodoby's girl"</a>
, I love it so much
It's exactly what I wanted, oh-oh
I am nobody's girl, does it mess you up?
That you had it, and you lost it? Oh-oh, body
How many times can I shape-shift into someone else?
No, there's no line when art turns to "Need serious help"
And when the job calls, gotta get it done, gotta put myself second to none
<p> At 22, it's a little sad, but it's fun
And when I ask, the angels sing, they say (baby, please, won't you see my side?)
"Real love doesn't clip your wings"
I love, love and affection, and fancy things (baby, please, won't you see my side?)
<b>But I think I like me more</b></p>
And when I cry, gotta wonder why (baby, please, won't you see my side?)
Every tear's in the shape of mankind
When one closes, the universe opens a new door, now I
